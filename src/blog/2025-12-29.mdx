Going into 2025 I had countless plans for my life. Graduating. Finding a "proper" job. Growing my content as a streamer. And so so much more. But that isn't what really happened.

Looking back, I wasn't proud of my year, I felt like I wasted it and I kept asking myself, *"Do I really have what it takes?"* To be an artist, to be a streamer, to be a creator. Yet the answer was a hard **"No"** everytime.

I was ashamed of myself, ashamed of how I spent my time. I didn't fit into the mould of what I thought a "successful" career. I wasn’t sitting at a neat desk in an office. I didn’t have a fixed schedule to follow. And I certainly didn’t have a title my parents could proudly gloat about.

But looking through the eyes of those around me, namely my friends and my partner, was I truly as unsuccessful as I thought myself to be?

To my peers from high school and university, I seemed to be charging ahead without a glance back, following a path I had laid out despite how irregular it was in our culture; To my friends online, I was carving my way to adulthood without my hands being held, determined to make something of myself and prove the doubters wrong. In their eyes, I was fierce. Determined. Successful.

So what does it truly mean to be successful? Who decides the measure of it? And who is keeping score?

While I may not have landed a “proper” office job, I was still self-sustainable. While I didn’t create as much content as I dreamed I would, I built a solid community that supported every project I started. And that, in itself, is success. The ability to carve a path despite doubt, to persist through uncertainty, and to attract kind-hearted souls to accompany me on my journey.

I still have a long way to go, and I may never be fully satisfied of my own performances. But sometimes, most times, I need to sit back and remember that I am still young, I still have time. And while success didn't look the way I was told it should, I'm not far from it either. All it takes is a slight shift in perspective, and a little more faith to those who already placed their trust by me.
